Hello Amirpasha, 
Kindly note the following:
1. Model_training.py script contains code that trains word2vec model and save the same as 'mymodel.kv'
2. Similar_words.py script contains code that loads the trained model and print top 20 words similar to 'good' and 'bad'
3. mymodel.kv (zip file) is the trained model that contains the vectors. (for quick check of the output)
